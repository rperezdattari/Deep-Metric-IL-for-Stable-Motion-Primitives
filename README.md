## Installation with poetry

You can install the package using poetry.
```bash
poetry install
```

Enter the virtual environment using:
```bash
poetry shell
```

Requirements can be found at `pyproject.toml`.
`
## Usage
In the folder `src` run:

### Training
```bash
  python train.py --params <params_file_name>
```
The parameter files required for the argument `params_file_name` can be found in the folder `params`.

### Simulate learned 2D motion
```bash
  python simulate_ds.py
```

### Hyperparameter Optimization
```bash
  python run_optuna.py --params <params_file_name>
```

## Troubleshooting
